# Generating a Random Password -

Here I have created a random password generator.

This was created to generate a random password by following the parameters of the password being the length of >8 and <128 characters.

The motivation was to be able to generate a password that is random by having the user choose a length and a variety of characters such as numbers, letters and special characters. This is asked through a series of prompts, confirms and window alerts. 

I learnt how to use window prompts, window confirms as well as window alerts. These can be used to recieve the users input. For looping is a great way to loop content. I used if/else statements to alert the user if the input had been entered incorrectly. I += into a final array and that then generated the input amount chosen by the user.
